= TODOs

* [x] Money value object
* [x] add feature flag support
* [x] add ArchUnit
* [ ] arch unit -> fix domain model references and re-enable jMolecules rule -> this does not work because of an issue of archunit in kotlin (to be investigated)
* [ ] CRUD for reference data - if needed should be in different bounded context probably?
* [ ] other insurance types
