:base-url: https://localhost:8080
:imagesdir: docs


== Intro

This is a simple net income calculator for self employed people in Greece.
For starters, it focuses only in insurance of type TSMEDE.

== Tech stack

This is a Spring boot application written in Kotlin and built with Gradle.

=== Database

It uses PostgreSQL as a database.
Flyway is used for database migrations.

=== API

The API is exposed as openapi 3.0 standard: link:{base-url}/swagger-ui/index.html[]]

=== Security

Okta is used together with Spring security for authentication and authorization with Oauth OpenID Connect protocol.

The link:https://github.com/okta/okta-spring-boot[Okta Spring Boot Starter] is used which autoconfigures Spring Security.

An account has been created in Okta website.

To be able to log in use you can use these credentials:

====
test_user@test.com +
open12345
====

== Architecture

This is an attempt to use DDD together with the Hexagonal Architecture (ports and adapters).
You can see bellow the generic structure of the application:

== Usage

=== 1. Import the postman scripts in Postman:

- link:senik.postman_collection.json[Senik Postman Collection]
- link:senik-local.postman_environment.json[Senik Local Postman Environment]

=== 2. Start database

Use link:docker-compose.yaml[docker-compose].

=== 3 Start application (main class.)

=== 4 Start Postman

Retrieve an access token:

image::postman-token.png[]

Use the Okta credentials to login as a simple user.

After you have acquired the token you can call the different endpoints.

=== OpenAPI generator

TO generate locally the OpenApi json file (to be used for example in frontend) first start the application and then use the following command:

    gradle generateOpenApiDocs

The generated file is located in the build folder (openapi.json).

=== Some notes for local k8 dev:

from base folder (important!):

 docker build  -t otinanism/senik-ui -f apps/senik-ui/docker/Dockerfile .

  kubectl create deployment senik-ui --image=otinanism/senik-ui --dry-run=client --output=yaml

  kubectl create deployment senik --image=otinanism/senik --dry-run -o=yaml > deployment.yaml

  kubectl create service clusterip senik --tcp=8080:8080 --dry-run -o=yaml >> service.yaml

  k3d cluster create mycluster -p "8081:80@loadbalancer"

or to expose NodePorts in host:

  k3d cluster create mycluster2 --api-port 6550 -p "8081:80@loadbalancer" -p "30000-32767:30000-32767@server:0"

--> this hangs, use maybe less ports?

  k3d cluster create mycluster --api-port 6550 -p "8081:80@loadbalancer" -p "30000-30020:30000-30020@server:0" -v C:\Users\alx\k3d\volumes:/var/lib/rancher/k3s/storage@all

--> ATTENTION! for volume mount to work it needs to be run from powershell!!!

  ./gradlew bootBuildImage --imageName=otinanism/senik

For the moment, this entry needs to be in hosts file:

  127.0.0.1 kubernetes.docker.internal
